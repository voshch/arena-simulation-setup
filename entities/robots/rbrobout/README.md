## Quick Usage

```
ros2 launch robotnik_description robot_description.launch.py robot:=ROBOT [robot_model:=ROBOT_MODEL]
```

Launches the description of a ROBOT, specifically ROBOT_MODEL.

## Structure

The description of a robot is divided into three parts:

- **robot**: The whole robot, including all its parts and customizations.
- **base**: The basic unit for each robot, composed of chassis + wheels.
- **body**: The chassis of each robot.

This repository contains three high-level folders:

- **robots**: Contains the URDF for complete robots, including the mobile base, arms, sensors, etc.
- **urdf**: Contains the URDF files of components that compose a robot.
- **meshes**: Contains the 3D meshes for each individual component of the robots.

### Robots

The `robots` folder contains a folder for each robot type:

 - rbkairos
 - rbrobout
 - rbsummit
 - rbvogui
 - rbtheron

Inside each robot type folder, there may exist several versions.

### URDF

The `urdf` folder contains a folder for each main component:

  - **bases**: Body of robots, including wheels, structures, and arms.
  - **bodies**: Includes chassis.
  - **structures**: Other structures included in a robot (e.g., columns, protection, elevator, support, etc.).
  - **wheels**: Contains the different types of wheels.

- **joint_states** (`sensor_msgs/msg/JointState`)

  The joint state updates to the robot poses.

#### Output Topics

- **~/robot_description** (`std_msgs/msg/String`)

  The description of the robot URDF as a string.

- **tf** (`std_msgs/msg/String`)

  The transforms corresponding to the movable joints of the robot.

- **tf_static** (`std_msgs/msg/String`)

  The transforms corresponding to the static joints of the robot.

### Arguments

- **namespace** (string, default: `robot`)
